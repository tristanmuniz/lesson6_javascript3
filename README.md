### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned how to create a for loop that changes the value og img src attributes by using the populateFigures() funtion.
2. I learned the difference between the BOM and the DOM. BOM is the convention through which JavaScript specifies the objects, properties and methods of the browser and the realtionshipbetween them. While, the DOM represents the contents of a document within the browser and is part of the BOM.
3. I learned how to create a new element node using the createElement() method and that this is part of the DOM.
